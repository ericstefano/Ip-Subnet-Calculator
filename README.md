# IP-Subnet-Calculator

This is a basic IP Subnet Calculator that I made with Python to learn the about Classes and Objects.

# Features:

- A binary converter made by me ( I only found out later that Python had a built-in binary converter)
- Discover the CIDR, Netmask, Wildcard, Network, Broadcast, MinimumHosts, MaximumHosts and Hosts per Net only with an IP Address and a CIDR number.
