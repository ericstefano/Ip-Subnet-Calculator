# IP-Subnet-Calculator

This is a basic IP Subnet Calculator that I made using Python to learn about Classes and Objects.

# Features:

- Binary to Decimal and Decimal to Binary converters made by me (I only found out later that Python had built-in binary converters.)

- With an IP Address and a CIDR you can Calculate and find out the:

Netmask;
Wildcard;
Network;
Broadcast;
MinimumHosts;
MaximumHosts;
Hosts per Net;
